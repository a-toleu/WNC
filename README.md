# Clustering-based topic modeling (CTM)
Word network clustering (WNC), is a clustering-based approach to topic modeling via analyzing word networks based on the adaptation of a community detection algorithm. Word networks are constructed with different word representations, and two types of topic assignments are introduced. Topic coherence score and the document clustering results are reported for topic model evaluation. Experimental results showed that it achieved comparable results with the current best. It also showed that the proposed approach produced a higher performance as the number of most relevant words gets larger in Cv coherence score.

## Concepts
Clustering-based topic model decomposes the large search space into two sub-spaces: |T| × |W| and |D| × |T|. Each of the sub-spaces cannot be very large in practice since |T| ≪ |D| and |T| ≪ |W|. First of all, the hidden topics of documents are found with a clustering algorithm in a subspace |T | × |W |, then the topic assignments in another small sub-space |T | × |D|. To uncover the thematic structure of a collection of documents, we proposed an approach based on adapting a community detection algorithm on a word network where vertices are words and edges are the distances between words. Several word representations are utilized for word network construction, and their effectiveness was compared through a set of experiments. To better assign the document with topics, two topic assignment approaches were applied and compared.
